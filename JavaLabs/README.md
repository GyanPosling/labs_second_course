- JMeter load testing scenario for real REST API endpoints
- CLI-ready JMeter report generation instructions
- Validation for incoming requests
- Composite creation demo showing partial save vs transactional rollback
- Service execution time logging via Spring AOP
- Mockito-based unit tests for the service layer
- OpenAPI documentation via Springdoc
